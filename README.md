Simple script to monitor UPS using the NUT upsc command on mac computer (installed using homebrew) and then use swiftbar to display UPS status in the menubar 

When using swiftbar rename filename to change update frequency e.g. for 5 minutes nut-ups-monitor.5m.sh and then copy to Swiftbar plugin directory
